# Phase 9: UI/UX Improvements - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The UI should feel as tight and intentional as a well-designed native mobile app. Right now there's wasted space across the board — the receipt upload section, item list spacing, and edit forms all feel loose. After this phase, the app should feel denser and more polished.

The receipt upload should be a single button that lets the OS handle source selection (camera or photo library). No need for two separate buttons when the system picker does this naturally.

Items should be packed tighter with minimal padding — just enough space to tap comfortably, maximizing how many items are visible on screen without scrolling.

Edit mode needs a layout rethink. Currently it has multiple issues: input fields wrapping awkwardly on narrow screens, buttons overflowing or pushing content around, and generally feeling cramped while also taking too much space.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Native-app density** - The whole UI should feel as tight as a polished mobile app, not a web page with generous spacing
- **Single upload button** - One button for receipt capture, OS handles camera vs photo library selection
- **Fixed edit layout** - Edit mode that works cleanly on all screen widths without wrapping or overflow issues

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- Receipt upload: Single button that opens system file picker (naturally offers camera or files)
- Item list: Minimal padding, maximize items visible on screen
- Edit form: Needs redesign to handle narrow screens without breaking layout
- General: Tighten spacing across all components, not just these specific areas

</specifics>

## Additional Context

All three improvement areas (upload consolidation, item spacing, edit layout) are equally important — this is a general polish pass, not focused on one specific fix. The goal is making the app feel finished and intentional rather than a rough prototype.
