### UAT-001: Price input editing is impractical

**Discovered:** 2026-01-14
**Phase/Plan:** 02.1-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Item price editing
**Description:** The price input field cannot be easily cleared or overridden. When the value is $0.00, the user cannot delete the numbers to enter a new value. Additionally, the input displays number spinner arrows (up/down) which are unnecessary for price entry.
**Expected:** User can select all text and type a new value, or clear the field. No spinner arrows on price inputs.
**Actual:** Cannot delete existing numbers to override. Spinner arrows are visible and take up space.
**Resolution:** Fixed in 02.1-01-FIX - Changed to type="text" with inputMode="decimal", added onFocus select, removed spinner arrows
**Fixed:** 2026-01-14 (commit 95f32d2)
