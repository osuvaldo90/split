<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add share code display to Session page</name>
  <files>src/pages/Session.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add a "Share this bill" section to the Session page that displays after items exist:

1. Create a ShareCode component inline or as separate file (inline is fine for simplicity)
2. Display when items.length > 0 (after receipt has been confirmed)
3. Layout:
   - "Share this bill" heading
   - Large code display (text-3xl or larger, monospace, letter-spacing for readability)
   - "Copy code" button next to or below the code
   - Brief instruction: "Give this code to friends to join"
4. Copy button behavior:
   - Use navigator.clipboard.writeText()
   - Show "Copied!" feedback briefly (useState for copied state, setTimeout to reset)
5. Position this section prominently after the session header, before items list

Styling from CONTEXT.md: "easy to say out loud at a table" - make code large and clear.
Mobile-first: large tap target for copy button.
