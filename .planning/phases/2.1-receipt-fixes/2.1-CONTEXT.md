# Phase 2.1: Receipt Fixes - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-14
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

This is a bug-squashing phase to clean up rough edges before moving to session management. The fixes should feel seamless — users shouldn't even notice these were issues, things should just work right.

**Receipt replacement:** When someone re-uploads a receipt, it's a clean slate. The old items disappear, new ones take their place, no questions asked. If items already exist, the upload buttons should change their text to indicate replacement ("Re-scan" instead of "Upload") so users know what will happen.

**Quantity item display:** The current UI shows "item [price] x [qty]" which reads like "price each" when it's actually "price total". Should display as "2x bitburger pils $13.00 total" — quantity first, then item, with the price clearly labeled as the total amount.

**Money formatting:** All prices should display consistently as $X.XX (never $4.8). Input fields should let users type freely, then format to proper currency when they leave the field.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **No ambiguity on quantity items** — It must be immediately clear whether a price is per-item or total
- **Clean replacement** — Re-uploading just works, no leftover items from previous scans
- **Consistent formatting** — Every price looks the same: $X.XX

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- Upload buttons change text when items exist: "Re-scan receipt" / "Replace receipt"
- Quantity display format: "2x item name $13.00 total"
- Money inputs format on blur, not while typing

</specifics>

## Additional Context

All three fixes are equally important — this is cleanup work to get the receipt flow feeling polished before adding session management complexity.

The quantity display issue was discovered when "2 bitburger pilsner $13.00" showed as "bitburger pils [13] x [2]" which looked like each beer was $13.
