# Phase 7: Summary & Display - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-14
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Phase 6 already built the core Summary screen with participant totals, breakdowns, and unclaimed warnings. This phase is lightweight — the main addition is giving users the ability to view the original receipt image.

The receipt image should be accessible from the Items tab (not Summary), since that's where users are actively working with items. An unobtrusive link-button in the receipt section keeps it discoverable without cluttering the interface.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Receipt image viewing** — Ability to see the original scanned receipt from the Items tab
- **Unobtrusive access** — A simple link-button in the receipt section, not a prominent feature

</essential>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Link-button placement: In the receipt section on the Items tab
- Should expand to full screen or modal when tapped
- Not needed in Summary tab — keep Summary focused on totals

</specifics>

## Additional Context

Phase 6 already delivered most of what was originally planned for Phase 7:
- Summary screen with all participant totals
- Per-person breakdown (Items, Tax, Tip)
- Expandable participant cards showing claimed items
- Unclaimed item warnings (non-blocking)
- Group total display

This phase is a small addition to complete the feature set.
