# Phase 03.1 FIX: UAT Issue Fix Summary

**New items auto-enter edit mode by detecting empty name on mount**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-14T23:55:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-14T23:57:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Fixed UAT-001: Add Item now opens in edit mode immediately
- Minimal change: single line modification to InlineItem.tsx
- No prop drilling or Session.tsx changes required

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Fix UAT-001 - auto-enter edit mode** - `316d78a` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/InlineItem.tsx` - Changed `useState(false)` to `useState(item.name === "")` for isEditing initial state

## Decisions Made

- Detect new items by checking `item.name === ""` rather than adding an `initialEditMode` prop
- Rationale: Simpler, no API changes, leverages the fact that new items are always created with empty name

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Fix complete, ready for re-verification with `/gsd:verify-work 3.1`
- If verification passes, phase 3.1 is fully complete
