## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. OCR Items Save Directly
expected: Take a photo or upload a receipt image. After OCR processing, items appear directly in the session view. No separate "confirm" or "review" step is shown.
result: pass

### 2. Edit Item Name
expected: Tap the edit button (pencil icon) on any item. Name becomes editable. Change the name and tap Save. Item updates immediately.
result: pass

### 3. Edit Item Price
expected: In edit mode, change the item price. Tap Save. Price updates and displays formatted correctly (e.g., $4.80).
result: pass

### 4. Delete Item
expected: In edit mode, tap the Delete button. Item is removed from the list immediately.
result: pass

### 5. Add Item Manually
expected: Tap "Add Item" button. A new item row appears in edit mode. Enter name and price, tap Save. Item is added to the list.
result: issue
reported: "no. a new item is added but it is not in edit mode and the name is empty and the price is 0"
severity: major
root_cause: Session.tsx line 268 calls addItem mutation directly with empty name/price, then renders InlineItem which defaults isEditing=false. Should either: (1) add item to DB and auto-open edit mode via prop, or (2) use local "new item" state before saving to DB.

### 6. Non-Host Can Edit Items
expected: Join a session as a non-host participant. You can edit, add, and delete items just like the host.
result: pass
