# Phase 11: Security Review - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A full systematic audit walkthrough of the entire application before shipping to real users. Every endpoint and component gets reviewed against a security checklist, with findings documented in separate reports by category.

The goal is confidence to ship — peace of mind that the app is safe for real users. Not about learning or documentation for its own sake, but about verifying the app is secure.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Comprehensive coverage** - No shortcuts. API authorization, input validation, and data exposure all equally important
- **Checklist-based verification** - Every endpoint and component reviewed systematically so nothing gets missed
- **Verifiable completeness** - Know when the audit is actually done, not just when we feel done

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- Per-area reports: separate documents for auth, validation, data exposure, etc.
- Organized by security domain rather than by file or feature
- No specific areas of concern flagged — open to whatever the audit finds
