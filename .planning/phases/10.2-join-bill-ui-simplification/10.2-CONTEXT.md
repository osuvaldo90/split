# Phase 10.2: Join Bill UI Simplification - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A unified form on the home page that handles both creating new bills and joining existing ones. One name field, one optional code field, and a smart button that adapts to what you've entered.

When you land on the home page, your name is pre-filled from the last time you used the app. The code field is empty with a placeholder like "ABC123" showing the format. The button says "Start Bill" by default.

If you enter a bill code, the button instantly changes to "Join Bill" with a subtle color shift. If the code is invalid, you get an inline error below the code field — the form stays as-is so you can fix it.

The code field auto-uppercases as you type. Both fields are stacked vertically: name on top, code below, button at the bottom.

Bill history stays separate below the form. Tapping a history item joins that bill instantly (current behavior preserved).

First-time users see an empty name field with a "Your name" placeholder.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Zero friction AND clarity** - Minimum taps to get into a bill, but always obvious what action you're about to take
- **Smart button adaptation** - Button text changes between "Start Bill" and "Join Bill" based on whether code is entered
- **Pre-filled name** - Returning users see their saved name ready to go
- **Inline error handling** - Invalid codes show error without disrupting the form

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- Stacked layout: Name → Code → Button (vertical)
- Name pre-filled from localStorage for returning users
- Code field: uppercase auto-format, placeholder "ABC123"
- Button: instant text/color change when code entered
- Subtle color difference between "Start Bill" (primary) and "Join Bill" (secondary shade)
- Invalid code: inline error below code field, form preserved
- Bill history: separate section, tap-to-join-instantly preserved

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This is a bigger scope than originally described in the roadmap. Instead of just simplifying the join flow, we're unifying the create and join flows into a single form. The original "expandable join section" approach is being replaced with this more integrated design.

The key insight: since home already has a name input for creating bills, having a separate name input just for joining is redundant. One form that adapts is cleaner.
