# Phase 10.1 Plan 02: Combine Join Bill into Home Summary

**Home page now has expandable "Join a Bill" section, reducing navigation steps - /join route removed.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-15T06:32:02Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-15T06:33:35Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2 (1 deleted)

## Accomplishments

- Added expandable "Join a Bill" button to home page
- Ported complete join flow from Join.tsx (code input, session lookup, name input, join handler)
- Preserved auto-rejoin via localStorage participant verification
- Removed redundant /join route and Join.tsx file
- Reduced modules from 124 to 123

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add expandable join section to Home page** - `a8827f1` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Remove Join page and route** - `04bff5c` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Added join bill state, queries, mutations, and expandable UI section
- `src/App.tsx` - Removed /join route and Join import
- `src/pages/Join.tsx` - Deleted (functionality moved to Home.tsx)

## Decisions Made

- **Expandable section over modal:** Button expands in-place to show join form - feels native and maintains context
- **Preserve all Join.tsx logic:** Auto-rejoin, error handling, status messages all ported exactly

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 10.1 complete (2/2 plans finished)
- All UX bug fixes complete
- Ready for Phase 11 (Security Review)
