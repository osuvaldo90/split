# Requirements: Split v1.1

**Defined:** 2026-01-15
**Core Value:** Seamless, real-time collaborative bill splitting that works instantly for anyone with a phone and a browser.

## v1.1 Requirements

### Access Control

- [x] **ACCESS-01**: Direct `/bill/:id` URL requires joining session before viewing bill content
- [x] **ACCESS-02**: All Convex mutations verify caller is a joined participant before executing
- [x] **ACCESS-03**: Tax and tip mutations enforce host-only restriction

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Session Management

- **SESS-01**: Host can remove users from session

### UX Enhancements

- **UX-01**: Bill ID tap opens native share sheet
- **UX-02**: Bottom tabs with route-based navigation
- **UX-03**: First-time user getting started tutorial

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from v1.1. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Payment processing | Core decision: show who owes what, not handle payments |
| User accounts | Core decision: anonymous sessions reduce friction |
| Offline functionality | Core decision: requires internet throughout |
| Desktop-first design | Core decision: mobile-first priority |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated by create-roadmap.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| ACCESS-01 | Phase 14 | Complete |
| ACCESS-02 | Phase 14 | Complete |
| ACCESS-03 | Phase 14 | Complete |
