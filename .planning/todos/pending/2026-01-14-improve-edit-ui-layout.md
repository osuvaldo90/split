title: Improve edit UI layout to prevent wrapping
area: ui
files:
  - src/components/InlineItem.tsx
---

## Problem

The inline edit UI for items wraps awkwardly on some screen sizes, making it look ugly. The current stacked vertical layout (from 08-02 decision) helps on mobile but the overall edit form could be improved for better visual appearance.

## Solution

TBD - Options to explore:
- Better input sizing and spacing
- Improved responsive breakpoints
- Consider different layout approaches for edit mode
- Review spacing and padding in edit form
