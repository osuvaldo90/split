title: Combine join bill into the home page
area: ui
files: []
---

## Problem

Currently the "Join Bill" flow is separate from the home page, requiring users to navigate to a different screen to enter a bill code. This creates unnecessary friction and extra steps.

Combining the join bill input directly into the home page would:
- Reduce navigation steps for joining participants
- Make the primary actions (create or join) immediately visible
- Simplify the overall app structure

## Solution

TBD — consider:
- Adding a bill code input field directly on the home page
- Single page with both "Start a Bill" and "Join a Bill" options
- Streamlined layout that keeps the home page clean while exposing both flows
