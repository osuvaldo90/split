title: Make edit form prettier with better layout
area: ui
files:
  - src/components/InlineItem.tsx

## Problem

The inline item edit form looks unpolished. Beyond just the overflow/wrapping issues (covered in separate todo), the overall aesthetic could be improved - it feels cramped and utilitarian rather than clean and intuitive.

## Solution

TBD - Consider:
1. Better visual hierarchy between name and price inputs
2. More polished button styling
3. Better spacing and alignment
4. Consider a different UX pattern entirely (slide-out drawer, modal, etc.)
